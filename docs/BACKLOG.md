# THE BACKLOG — everything this project has said needs doing

*Collected 2026-08-03 at the user's request: "let's build a doc that
collects everything we are saying needs to be done or should be done."
Until now these lived scattered through HANDOFF-MK2.md session entries and
the research files, which is where intentions go to be lost.*

**HOW TO READ THIS.** Every item says WHY it is open and WHAT would close
it. Nothing here is a wish: each one was found by measurement or named by
a source. Items are grouped by what they cost, not by when they appeared.

---

## 0. THE ONE THAT OUTRANKS EVERYTHING

**THE EAR HAS NOT HEARD ALMOST ANY OF THE RECENT WORK.** The FDN room, the
whole stereo build, the matrix, the field, the stage, the flanger, the
DP/4, the snap — all measured, none listened to. This project's own
precedent (the sax: every metric green, the ear refused it) says
measurements prove a thing EXISTS and never that it sounds good. **Nothing
should be built on top of this stack until it has been played.**

---

## 1. DEFECTS AND GAPS FOUND BY MEASUREMENT

| what | why it is open | what closes it |
|---|---|---|
| **No check knows WHICH ROOM ran** | The FDN silently fell back to the convolver for a whole build and every probe still passed: a convolver is repeatable, and its IR length *is* its decay. `soundState().room` reports it for the LIVE graph only. | A render-side assertion — the room should be able to state which engine produced a buffer. |
| **Random Hall makes ringing WORSE** | Measured 25.3 → 31.3 dB peak-to-median on a time-averaged tail. Ships OFF (`space.random: 0` everywhere). | Either a better implementation (the unverified diagnosis: per-line decay gain is computed for the NOMINAL length, so a wandering tap detunes the network) or a better metric. Distrust the current metric until it disagrees with a fixed network in Lexicon's direction. |
| **15 rendered-audio checks fail, and 13 of them are ONE STALE CHECK** | Re-measured 2026-08-03o: **316 passed, 15 failed**, and the same 15 to the last digit on the commit before it, so none of them belong to the barberpole. **13 are `"reverb return present, at depth"`** — side/mid above its ceiling (0.16–0.28 against 0.16). That ceiling is `max(0.16, wet) + gate allowance` and it was calibrated when **the reverb was the only thing in the program making side energy**. The stereo stage now pans the players, so a correct mix fails a check that predates it. The other two: `"the section marked peak is the loudest"` on seed 2 (−14.50 vs −13.99, half a dB) and `"both channels carry the mix"` (L/R +1.6 dB on two choruses — a stage that leans). | Re-derive the side/mid ceiling from what is actually panned rather than from `wet` alone. **Do not just raise the number**: the check's whole value is that it fails when the return disappears, and a ceiling chosen to make today's mix pass proves nothing. The earlier note in this row (8 failures, sub-runaway, kit-free prechorus) described a battery that has since changed shape; the numbers above replace it. |
| **The gated reverb is still a ConvolverNode** | Which is why genres with a gate sit at the ~-100 dB float floor instead of bit-exact. | Either move it into the room worklet or accept and document permanently. |
| **Section-keyed mix moves automating buses that are SILENT in that section** | Found 2026-08-03 preparing the listening session, measured with `harness/probe_section_motion.js` (drive the control end-to-end inside the very section its move is keyed to; the difference signal is what it could possibly change there). **lofi's "Tubby pair"** — `matrix.leadMix`/`leadEcho` at the outro, the "record ends by receding" move — is keyed to a section whose role list (`["keys","bass"]`) has never included the lead: **-95.8 dB** of possible change in the outro against **-5.6 dB** in a chorus. Its intro half acts on a single leaked pickup note. **jungle's bridge drum-drop** — `drumsMix` cut + `drumsEcho` rise, the engineer's dub move — is keyed to a bridge whose roles are `["bass","keys"]`: **-90.5 dB** there, **-6.4 dB** in a chorus. The arrangement removes the drums before the mixer's hand arrives, so the kit mutes instead of washing away into the echo. The comments describe the arrangement the writer imagined, not the one the roles table produces — and nothing compared the two (the polymeter shape, again). Role tables alone cannot adjudicate: plastikman's bridge plays only the ostinato and its keys bus is LIVE there at **-3 dB** (the ostinato rides the keys bus in that rig), so its `keysMix` bridge cut is real — while its bass bus reads **-88.9 dB** in the same bars, so its `bassEcho` bridge dip is not. | Per move, a decision on the record: either re-key the move to a section where its bus sounds, or put the role INTO the section so the mixer's move has something to act on (jungle's own research wants the second: the drums leaving *into the echo* needs drums written in the bridge and removed by the FADER, not by the arrangement). Both change what songs play → research the shape first, re-baseline deliberately, and let the user's ears rule (the listening session in `test/ears/LOG.md` already asks the lofi-ending and jungle-drop questions). A seam check comparing every section-keyed move against what its bus carries there would close the class; `probe_section_motion.js` is the measuring arm. |
| **`intro` bars = 4 undercount** | The target-length arithmetic treats a cold open as 0 bars and a normal intro as 4, which is not what the form actually produces. | Its own measured commit. |
| **MIDI wall-clock flake** | `mk2_midi` fails "no tick drifts" under load; always green on rerun. Documented, never ignored. | Nothing, unless it starts failing when idle. |

## 2. METHODOLOGY — how this project measures

- **A render A/B without a same-build control measures its own noise.**
  Two separate mistakes this session were caught only by running that
  control. Past handoff entries argued from render A/Bs with no control;
  they are not thereby wrong, but they are unverified in that respect.
- **Anything that LISTS what the program contains will go stale.** Three
  times in one session: the seam scanner's read-detection, the probe's
  column names (twice). Derive it from the declaration instead.
- **Run `probe_wiring` after adding anything.** A capability one genre uses
  is a capability that has not been understood yet.

## 3. THINGS BUILT BUT BARELY CONNECTED

Measured by `probe_wiring`, 2026-08-03:

- **flanger, DP/4, snap — one genre each** (plastikman). Sourced candidates
  named already: jungle's drops and synthwave's prechorus both want a hard
  cut; the FX columns want a genre-by-genre pass.
- **The barberpole is on two** (synthwave, plastikman) — better than one and
  still thin. `barberpole.md` §6 gives the test for a third: the DAFx paper
  only claims the illusion works "at slow modulation speeds and for input
  signals with a rich frequency spectrum", so it belongs on a genre with a
  sustained wash, not on a sparse one.
- **acid and jungle have no panning at all** — their draws land on machines
  with no `pan` control. Either give those machines the stereo stage or
  accept it as their character, in writing.
- **`stage` on two genres** (lofi, synthwave). Five to go, and it is the
  cheapest way to make the field mean something on every record.

## 4. GENRE WORK NAMED AND NOT DONE

- **Form plans for dkc, acid, plastikman.** Four genres have one; these
  three still walk planlessly. Plastikman has the strongest sources
  (Hawtin's "year of subtraction"; *Consumed*'s single-take arc).
- **The `snap` for jungle and synthwave** — see §3.
- **One coincidental dkc↔bladerunner twin** in probe_form; expected to
  vanish when those genres get plans.
- **Pickups realise 8.2% against the corpus's 26%** — `fits()` blocks some;
  a taste dial, [EAR].

## 5. SOUND WORK NAMED AND NOT DONE

- **The other two Hawtin units are UNRESEARCHED**: Roland SRV-330
  "Dimensional Space" and the ART Multiverb (gated reverb on claps — we
  have a gated verb, never compared). See `fx-units.md`, which says
  plainly not to build from the guesses written there.
- **Three things the barberpole's sources describe and we did not build**,
  listed with their reasons in `barberpole.md` §5: Whirl's **stereo phase
  offset between channels** (ours offsets between NOTCHES — this is the one
  worth doing, now that the program is stereo), its **through-zero direction
  change** (inert here: direction is per song, so nothing changes
  mid-sweep), and its **negative feedback** (a feedback path around the
  cascade closes a cycle, and a cycle has already been measured to cost the
  renderer its repeatability).
- **Cross-modulation for plastikman.** *Consumed* is "an album of feedback,
  everything cross-modulating everything else". The grid cannot do it —
  a cycle costs repeatability — so it belongs inside worklet arithmetic.
- **A matrix-fed room (FDN with an orthogonal feedback matrix)** — stability
  becomes structural rather than swept. Design in `matrix-mixer.md` §7.
- **Stem columns** — the professional "mix of mixes" pattern; the program
  already renders stems.
- **Rubato.** No mechanism exists for free tempo inside a section; groove
  jitter is not it. Named in `bladerunner-form.md`.
- **Harmony and chromaticism**, including two-chord stasis. Named in the
  same place.
- **The sax is PARKED.** Terms for un-parking are in the handoff's warning
  block: real multisamples or a waveguide, ear-gated on one exposed note
  BEFORE any system is built around the tone.

## 6. MUSIC THEORY — the engine, what it has and what it lacks

*Added 2026-08-03 at the user's direction: "improving the music theory engine
… counterpoint, better wider chords … a list of music theory we are missing
and need and what we have that needs improving." Every line below was verified
against the code or measured this session — line numbers are `Deckards
Orchestrator MK2.html`. Research: `docs/genre-research/lofi-harmony.md`,
`docs/genre-research/counterpoint.md`. Measurement:
`harness/probe_counterpoint.js` (new), plus `probe_theory`, `probe_comp`,
`probe_harmony_neo` re-run at this commit.*

**The one-line summary: the vertical vocabulary stops at a seventh, the
horizontal vocabulary does not exist, and six of seven genres are locked
diatonic.**

### 6.1 THE CHORD VOCABULARY STOPS AT FOUR NOTES — the root cause

`chordTones` (line 841) is the whole of chord construction:

```js
function chordTones(root, mode, d, seventh){
  const n = seventh ? 4 : 3, out = [];
  for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) out.push(degMidi(root, mode, d + 2 * i));
  return out;
}
```

| what | why it is open | what closes it |
|---|---|---|
| **9ths, 11ths and 13ths are unreachable by any code path** | `n` is 3 or 4 and nothing else. There is no extension parameter, no `add9`, no `sus`, no alteration. Two call sites only (13690, 15838). **This is the single highest-value item in this section** — `lofi-harmony.md` §2 finds NOT ONE plain triad across thirteen sourced lofi progressions (maj9, maj13, min11, min9, 7#5, 7b9, dim7, m7b5), and a genre whose chords sit unchanged for two bars needs each chord to be worth sitting on. | An extension/alteration dimension on the chord, declarable per genre, that `chordTones` reads. Constraints not values (Principle 1): a genre declares which extensions it may reach for, the draw decides. |
| **Chord QUALITY is never named — it is implied by mode + degree** | There is no `quality` field anywhere in the composer. A genre cannot ask for a dominant IV, which `lofi-harmony.md` §4 identifies as *the* discriminator between the two minor modes the genre lives between (Dorian's major IV vs Aeolian's minor iv). | Quality as an explicit field on a chord, so a table can name it. Prerequisite for §6.2 and for most of §6.4. |
| **`sevenths` is a per-genre BOOLEAN, and 6 of 7 say false** | lofi `true` (8618); synthwave, dkc, bladerunner, acid, jungle, plastikman all `false`. **DKC's own comment (10109) says "Wise's harmony is add9 and sus, not stacked sevenths" — a genre asking in writing for something the engine cannot build, and getting plain triads instead.** | Falls out of the two rows above. |
| **`triadTones`' dominant flag is dead** | `tri.dom` is set by NOTHING (`grep "dom:"` → no producer), so `!!tri.dom` at 13707 is permanently false. The comment at 895 says this flag "is what makes a secondary dominant pull." There are no secondary dominants. | Either wire it or delete it. A flag nothing sets is this file's cardinal sin with a comment on top. |

### 6.2 WIDER CHORDS — measured, and the target is sourced twice

| what | why it is open | what closes it |
|---|---|---|
| **The comp spans 12.2–13.0 semitones in every genre; the target is 24+** | Measured at this commit (`probe_comp`, 20 seeds): lofi 12.7, synthwave 12.3, dkc 12.6, bladerunner 13.0, acid 13.0, plastikman 12.2, jungle 12.9 — barely more than an octave, everywhere. **Two independent sources put it at two octaves or more**: the user's own comp photograph (`NOTES-FROM-THE-USER.md`, one bar framed B3/B4/D5/C6/F6 = 30 semitones) and a voicing guide ("Close voicings sound dense and pop-like. Lo-fi favors spread voicings where the notes span TWO OCTAVES OR MORE" [corpus:orphiq]). Per this repo's own standard, two agreeing sources is a target, not taste. | Not a constant to raise. `buildKeys` (14467) folds every tone into `R.keys` first, so the band IS the ceiling — lofi's `[52,74]` is 22 semitones and cannot contain a two-octave voicing plus its own inner movement. Needs the register architecture question the repo already parked: *"a comp spread across three octaves is one instrument covering the whole range and would overlap lanes the bass and lead are guaranteed. That is a decision about what this program is, and it has not been made."* Make it. |
| **`isOpen` is a BINARY, so a 13-semitone spread and a 30-semitone spread score identically** | 14584: `(cand[cand.length-1] - cand[0]) > 12`. The cost function can prefer "open" but cannot prefer "wider" — there is no gradient to climb even if the band allowed it. | A continuous spread term in the cost. Cheap, and a prerequisite for the row above doing anything. |
| **Drop-2 exists; drop-2-&-4 does not** | 14591–14594 generates one drop-2 per inversion. `lofi-harmony.md` §5 names drop-2-&-4 as the voicing that "spans nearly two octaves" — i.e. the actual mechanism for the target above. | Add it to the candidate generator. One loop. |
| **Rootless voicings are not built, and this program is the ideal case for them** | The sources' rationale is that a separate bass plays the root [corpus:pianowithjonny] — which is exactly this architecture. Rootless is also what MAKES ROOM for a 9th without a sixth voice. Pryn, voicing Cmin9 as C–B–D–G: "remove the fifth altogether because it is not essential to the harmony." | Depends on §6.1. |
| **Voices are paired by SORTED INDEX in the voice-leading cost** | 14644: `for(let i = 0; i < Math.min(cand.length, prev.length); i++)`. A 4-note chord following a 3-note one silently drops a voice from the comparison, and the extra voice contributes only through the `×2` top-line term. Latent today because chord size is constant within a song; **it goes live the moment §6.1 lands** and chords vary in size. | Fix before, not after, extensions land. |

### 6.3 COUNTERPOINT — the horizontal rules do not exist

**Verified: `grep -i "parallel fifth\|parallel octave\|perfect fifth\|voice cross\|similar motion\|oblique"` over the whole HTML returns ZERO hits — in code AND in comments.**

| what | why it is open | what closes it |
|---|---|---|
| **Nothing measures or constrains the interval between two parts** | The only cross-part constraint in the composer is a `reserved` set banning two parts from the same absolute pitch at the same instant — the degenerate case of a parallel unison — plus the counter's contrary-motion preference. `probe_theory` already half-recognises the issue from the other end, measuring "unisons" and calling one "a part disappearing rather than a chord" (lofi 8.8%). | `harness/probe_counterpoint.js` now measures it. The mechanism should follow the research's sorting (`counterpoint.md` §2): parallel perfects are PERCEPTION (fusion) and belong in stage 3 for every genre — **but only where `counter.style === "line"`**, because `"double"` is deliberate parallel octaves and the tables already say which is which. |
| **MEASURED at this commit (30 seeds a genre), parallel perfect vs a seeded-shuffle floor** | lofi 1.7% (chance 1.4), synthwave 6.0% (1.7 — the deliberate double), dkc 1.6% (1.1), bladerunner 2.6% (1.8), acid 1.3% (1.0), plastikman 0.7% (1.2), **jungle 24.5% (0.7)**. **CAVEAT, and it matters: the shuffle floor destroys the harmonic relationship between parts, so two lines that both correctly track the same chord changes will sit far above it without that being a defect.** The floor answers "more than random", NOT "wrong". | Do not treat the ratio as a defect count. The honest reading is that only jungle is a clear outlier, and §6.5 says what it actually is. |
| **The counter's contrary-motion rule is measured against the LEAD only, and is a flat +100** | 15514–15520. The comp's top voice — which `buildKeys` itself weights ×2 because "it is the line the ear follows" — is never consulted, so the counter can move in lockstep with the part the ear is actually tracking and pay nothing. And a flat penalty cannot separate similar-but-not-parallel from strictly parallel, which is exactly the distinction the sources draw. | Score against the comp's top voice as well, and grade the penalty by motion type. |
| **Leap-then-step is not built** | The non-chord-tone law narrows the note after a *dissonance* to one scale step, but nothing reads the previous interval for the plain melodic case: after a leap, prefer to step back, and "do not write more than one skip in the same direction" [corpus:hellomusictheory]. | A cost term in `buildTheme`'s candidate walk. |
| **Voice spacing is unconstrained** | No rule keeps adjacent voices within a tenth. | A cost, never a law — lofi's counter band `[57,74]` sits INSIDE its keys band `[52,74]`, so a hard rule is unsatisfiable by construction. |
| **Voice crossing: DO NOT ADD A BAN** | Recorded here so nobody "fixes" it. It is architectural — the code says so at 15594, *"The counter does not sit ABOVE the comp, it sits INSIDE it"* — and the sources agree that without crossing "no real polyphony is possible" [corpus:ars-nova, quoting Jeppesen]. | Nothing. This is a decision, written down. |

### 6.4 CHROMATICISM — built, drawn by almost nobody

| what | why it is open | what closes it |
|---|---|---|
| **Only ONE genre in the file declares a `harmony` block** | `bladerunner`, line 10446: `harmony: { style: "plr", chance: 0.30 }`. Everything else is 100% diatonic by construction. Measured (`probe_harmony_neo`, 60 seeds): bladerunner 10.4% chromatic chords, **every other genre exactly 0.0%**. | Genre-by-genre research before any table entry — `lofi-harmony.md` §4 already supplies lofi's case (the borrowed dominant IV, "a borrowed chord from another key" [corpus:richardpryn]) and it is the natural second genre. |
| **`coltraneCycle` is correct, wired, and unreachable** | Defined 887, called at 13715 under `H.style === "coltrane"`. **No genre declares that style** — `grep "coltrane"` finds only the branch itself. Still true after being flagged in HANDOFF §5.5 for several sessions. | Draw it somewhere with a documented reason, or delete it. The file's own rule, quoted at 13434: do not claim a thing works until something draws it. |
| **The neo path collapses a mode to one bit** | 13718: `min: MODES[mode][2] === 3`. A mode entering the P/L/R path becomes major-or-minor and its character is gone. | Fine for triads; revisit with §6.1. |

### 6.5 SCOPE GAPS in the laws that DO exist

| what | why it is open | what closes it |
|---|---|---|
| **The non-chord-tone law covers `lead` and `counter` only** | `bass`, `keys` and `ostinato` are never checked. A comp inner voice or a bass note may leap away from a dissonance freely. Whether it *should* be constrained is a real question — a bassline is not a melody — but it is currently unasked, not decided. | Decide per role, in writing. |
| **"Resolves by step" is hardcoded as ≤2 semitones** | So harmonic minor's degree 6→7 (an augmented second, 3 semitones) is a genuine scale step that the law refuses as a resolution. Latent — no genre draws `harmMinor` today. | Ask the MODE what a step is, rather than assuming a tone. |
| **`harmMinor` is defined in `MODES` (830) and drawn by NO genre** | Dead vocabulary in the theory block itself. | Draw it or drop it. |
| **`intoBand` assumes a band ≥12 semitones wide and never checks** | 912. The comment says "band width >= 12 assumed"; nothing enforces it, and a narrower band would oscillate. | A guard, or a stated invariant with a seam check. |
| **jungle has only TWO pitched parts and they shadow each other** | Measured: its only pair is bass↔keys; **69.9% of their vertical intervals are perfect (unison/octave/fifth) and 0.0% are dissonant**, with 24.5% parallel-perfect motion. `counter: null` is deliberate and defended, but the result is a genre whose entire harmony is two lines mostly a fifth or an octave apart. | A genre-identity question, not a bug. Jungle's harmony has never been researched (only its form has — `jungle-form.md`). |
| **synthwave's octave double flips octave on 13.1% of notes** | Measured: `octaves: [-12, 12]`, 86.9% at −12 and 13.1% at +12, because it takes whichever fits the band unreserved. Each flip is a two-octave leap in the counter against a stepping lead. | An EAR question, recorded not judged. If it is wrong, the fix is to prefer the previous offset. |
| **lofi's register comment is false** | 8636 claims the bands "overlap only at the edges — a countermelody that never crosses the comp is not one." Declared: counter `[57,74]`, keys `[52,74]` — the counter is a strict SUBSET. The code at 15594 states the truth. | Correct the comment next time the file is touched. |

### 6.6 THE MEASUREMENT SIDE — what the probes cannot see

| what | why it is open | what closes it |
|---|---|---|
| **`probe_theory` hand-copies a MODES table that has drifted from the engine's** | Its table (line 40) is MISSING `harmMinor` and ADDS `locrian` and `aeolian`, neither of which the engine has. A `harmMinor` song would fall through `MODES[mode] \|\| MODES.minor` and be silently measured against natural minor. **Latent — no genre draws harmMinor, so nothing is misreported today.** But this is the "anything that LISTS what the program contains will go stale" defect for the fifth time. | Export `MK2.MODES` and derive. |
| **`probe_comp` measures texture, not harmony** | Six numbers: simultaneity, onsets/bar, voices/onset, inner movement, bar repeat, span. **No chord identity, no inversion distribution, no voice-leading distance between successive voicings, no check that the voicing is even the chord.** It is a texture probe wearing a voicing name. | Add the harmonic half — it is the natural place to verify §6.1 and §6.2 once they land. |
| **`probe_harmony_neo` reads the abstract chart, never the played pitches** | It reads `song.materials.chords`, so it says nothing about what is actually voiced and heard. Its voice-leading number is a SET distance (line 35), order-free, and therefore cannot detect voice crossing or parallel motion by construction. | Point a version of it at `materials.*.keys`. |
| **`probe_counterpoint`'s floor control is generous, and its top-voice reduction hides inner voices** | Both stated in the file's own header. The shuffle floor breaks the chord relationship (see §6.3), and reducing each role to its top note means a parallel fifth buried inside a comp voicing is invisible. | A better floor would shuffle whole chord-aligned bars rather than individual pitches. Inner voices need the pair enumeration to run over voicing members, not roles. |

### 6.7 THE GROUNDING GAP — measured harmony exists in this repo and MK2 cannot see it

**`JAZZ_CORPUS`, `BACH_CORPUS`, `IMPROV_DIMENSIONS`, `FOLK_CORPUS` appear ZERO
times in `Deckards Orchestrator MK2.html`.** `corpus/` holds working ingesters
for all of them, and they target MK1:

- **`ingest_jazz.py`** — the **Jazz Harmony Treebank**, 1170 standards' chord
  changes (EPFL DCMLab), already converted to a relative `{degree, quality}`
  encoding with frequency weights. **Lofi's harmony is jazz harmony slowed
  down**, so this is the right instrument for exactly the question §6.1 asks,
  and it would replace most of `lofi-harmony.md`'s tutorial-grade sourcing with
  measured structure — the top of this project's own grounding ladder.
- **`ingest_bach.py`** — 382 chorales as four independent voices. That is a
  measured corpus of *counterpoint*, which is §6.3's whole subject.
- **`harvest_accompaniment.py`** — POP909, what an accompaniment actually plays.

**This outranks every other item in §6.** Every chord-quality weight and every
counterpoint rate this section proposes is currently `[EAR]` or sourced from
production tutorials; the treebank and the chorales would make them measured.
What closes it: port one ingester to MK2's tables and re-derive. Start with
jazz — it is the one whose subject matter matches a shipped genre.

## 7. UI

- **The field does not name the section's stage on the tube** — now that a
  stage is a thing, showing which one is running is small and obvious.
- **`probe_wiring`'s table belongs on screen**, not only in a terminal.
